# ss

This is a program for finding the maximum words with friends scores given a board and player tiles.  This is an extremely rough alpha version, it doesn't respect all the rules of play.

Todo List:
    When board is empty, only play on middle row or column ensure that middle spot is covered
    Check for played word adjancency (right now results that aren't adjancent to a current play are still shown)
    Attempt Verticle Plays as well as horizontal
    Completely unoptimized, went for functionality first
       Investigate why pmap didn't seem to improve performance profile
       Investigate other performance options

## Usage

From REPL:  (load-file "./src/ss/scrabble_solver.clj")

This will print the top 25 plays for an empty board with the tiles a, b, c, d, e, f and g.

Initial state setup is ugly...edit scrabble_solver to populate the board and player tiles

## Installation
